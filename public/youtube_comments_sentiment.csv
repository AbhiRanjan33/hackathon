can you please make video on how to integrate clerk using express in backend and nextjs as only frontend,Neutral,0,False,0,1 month ago
"@clerkdev I can't find information anywhere that tells me how to change light and dark mode for the clerk cards in my app. I can set the baseTheme in my ClerkProvider, but what if I want that theme to change if my user toggles light/dark modes? I've looked through the docs and had a peak at the package itself but I don't see a clear way to modify SignIn, SignUp, and the popup I get from UserButton so that I can use the current theme in styling the component, or telling it to use a given theme from @clerk/themes. Thoughts?",Neutral,0,False,0,1 month ago

"Hey, clerk elements are great! The only thing I cannot find in the documentation is the ""forceRedirectUrl"" using OAuth, similar when we use <SignInButton forceRedirectUrl={process.env.CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL} />
